  This quick-and-easy dish combines a sweet cherry tomato salad with pan-seared
  sirloin steaks and a fresh horseradish and crème fraiche sauce. Simple and
  light, yet hearty and comforting: "It's dedicated to that little mini-season
  between summer and fall," says Chef John. "That time of year when I crave
  hearty, comforting dishes that are still light and simple to make."
