  What Is Gazpacho? Gazpacho is a smooth, blended, cold soup made with fresh
  vegetables. Traditionally, tomatoes and cucumbers are heavily featured. The
  dish, which has Spanish and Portuguese origins, is a summer staple.

<p>
  This refreshing Spanish soup is the taste of high summer. Chef John calls it a
  "garden salad masquerading as a cold soup." The key is to use "killer,
  end-of-summer, super-sweet tomatoes," says Chef John. "There just isn't any
  substitute, so happy hunting." Serve cold in chilled bowls.
