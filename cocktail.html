  Cooked, cooled shrimp are mixed into a refreshing gazpacho-like sauce made
  with fresh tomatoes, English cucumber, red onion, celery, jalapenos, avocado,
  and cilantro. "This was the best shrimp cocktail ever!" raves kelly. "Served
  with warm naan bread and called it dinner. Perfect for summer!"

<h2>ingredients</h2>
<ul>
  <li>1 cup clam juice</li>
  <li>¼ teaspoon dried oregano</li>
  <li>1 pound large shrimp, peeled and deveined</li>
  <li>1 ¼ cups peeled, seeded, diced ripe tomatoes</li>
</ul>
<h2>STEPS</h2>
<ol>
  <li>
    Bring clam juice and oregano to a boil in a saucepan over medium-high heat.
    Add shrimp; cook and stir just until shrimp turn pink, about 2 minutes.
    (They will not be cooked through.) Transfer shrimp to a bowl with a slotted
    spoon; let cool to room temperature. Reserve liquid.
  </li>
  <li>
    While the shrimp are cooling, combine tomatoes, cucumbers, celery, onion,
    and jalapeños in a mixing bowl. Gently mix in reserved cooking liquid,
    ketchup, lime juice, 2 tablespoons cilantro, and hot sauce until well
    combined.
  </li>
  <li>
    Place four whole shrimp in a small bowl; cover with plastic wrap. Chop
    remaining shrimp into bite-sized pieces; add to vegetable mixture and stir
    to combine. Cover with plastic wrap. Refrigerate both bowls until thoroughly
    chilled, 2 to 3 hours.
  </li>
